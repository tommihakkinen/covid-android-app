Topic: Android application that displays Finland's covid statistics nationally, areally and locally using THL's api.
       The app's main view displays Finland's current number of registered covid cases, covid related deaths and percentage 
       of population that has received their first covid vaccine. User can also get the number of covid cases in their current
       city based on their device's location.
       The app features an interactable map of Finland that displays the number of covid cases and percentage of vaccinated 
       population in different health care districts.
