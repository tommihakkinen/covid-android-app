Topic: Android application that displays Finland's covid statistics nationally, areally and locally using THL's api.

Target: Android/Kotlin

Google Play link:

Release 1:
- App connects to THL's covid api.
- App displays overall cases of covid in Finland.

Release 2:
- App displays number of covid related deaths in Finland.
- App displays the percentage of Finnish population who have received their covid vaccine.
- App displays covid cases in the user's current city based on location.
- Interactable map view that demonstrates the different health care districts in Finland.
  User can view district specific covid case and vaccination information by pressing different areas on the map.

Known bugs:
- The district images in the map view are rectangles so the odd shaped ones' clickable areas can overlap with others, making them harder to press.
- Location does not work in Ahvenanmaa.
